# Introduction + Goals

The goal of the HuskyPal application is to allow students to explore and experience UW’s various activities and programs through an interactive and rewarding system. The HuskyPal application will include a virtual pet that allows users to further explore a variety of interests through their “Trait Track”, and users can pick a trait for their HuskyPal to be given a customized set of challenges and rewards that relate to their respective trait, which can also be shared with other HuskyPal users.
