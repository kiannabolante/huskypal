# HuskyPal

# Project Description 
Huskypal is an application that allows students to explore and experience UW’s various activities and programs through an interactive and rewarding system. The HuskyPal application will include a virtual pet that allows users to further explore a variety of interests through their “Trait Track”, and users can pick a trait for their HuskyPal to be given a customized set of challenges and rewards that relate to their respective trait, which can also be shared with other HuskyPal users.

HuskyPal aims to transform the UW student experience by making campus exploration more interactive, rewarding, and fun. It's about creating a sense of community, enhancing personal growth, and encouraging active participation in campus life through a digital-physical hybrid experience.Stay tuned for updates as we bring HuskyPal to life, and get ready to embark on your very own UW adventure with your new Husky companion!
