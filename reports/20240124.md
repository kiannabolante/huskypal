**Goals from last week**

Empty since this is the first week of status reports

**Progress and Issues**

As a team, we set up the GitHub Repository, started drafting our Architecture and Design early as suggested by our TA, came up with a general meeting structure, and figured out our minimum plans/functionality to accomplish by the end of the quarter (avatar customization, leveling system, personalized challenges, and connecting with peers).
We found that keeping consistent communication through text message/discord/in-person meetings helps a lot to make sure we’re all on the same page.
The only place where we might be stuck is just making sure we are fulfilling the requirements for the upcoming Architecture and Design  assignment correctly.


**Plans and goals for following week**

For the following week, we plan to finalize our content for the Architecture and Design assignment by going through any questions we have with our TA and working together to proofread content and ideas before submission.
We also hope to get started with development now that we have our GitHub repository ready. This would be getting all of our local working environments ready and starting on our respective roles and goals as outlined below.

**Project Meeting Agenda (1/23)**

Updates:
- Complete software architecture document before this thursday
- Thursday as a group, one person will draw and everyone can share ideas for a blueprint for our website of HuskyPal

Kianna Bolante: I set up the outlines/templates for the Architecture and Design and Team Meeting Agendas for everyone to work on, figured out coding guidelines for our project, and finished a UI mockup of what the web application would look like based off our team’s conversation on feasibility. I learned a lot about UI/UX designing in terms of design considerations. Something that I am stuck on is how to get started in coding the UI mockup into an actual functioning application.
