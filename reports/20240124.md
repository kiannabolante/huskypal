**_Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)_**

**Goals from last week**

Empty since this is the first week of status reports

**Progress and Issues**

As a team, we set up the GitHub Repository, started drafting our Architecture and Design early as suggested by our TA, came up with a general meeting structure, and figured out our minimum plans/functionality to accomplish by the end of the quarter (avatar customization, leveling system, personalized challenges, and connecting with peers).
We found that keeping consistent communication through text message/discord/in-person meetings helps a lot to make sure we’re all on the same page.
The only place where we might be stuck is just making sure we are fulfilling the requirements for the upcoming Architecture and Design  assignment correctly.


**Plans and goals for following week**

For the following week, we plan to finalize our content for the Architecture and Design assignment by going through any questions we have with our TA and working together to proofread content and ideas before submission.
We also hope to get started with development now that we have our GitHub repository ready. This would be getting all of our local working environments ready and starting on our respective roles and goals as outlined below.

**Project Meeting Agenda (1/23)**

Updates:
- Complete software architecture document before this thursday
- Thursday as a group, one person will draw and everyone can share ideas for a blueprint for our website of HuskyPal
- Clone repos into our chosen software (VSCode)
- Planning to meeting up over the weekends


Questions to ask during section on Thursday:
- Ask for feedback Thursday section or on Ed and submit by Friday 1/26
- Ask our TA for how to acquire login information from MyUw so we can have people sign up to HuskyPal with their Uw email

**Progress and Issues**

Fana Hagos: We discussed what we wanted to do next week and what features we wanted to add. We also decided to make a wireframe which is really helpful to get started on the project and set up the workspace, and decide what kind of tool we were going to use in the future. I worked on the diagram for the architecture and design document. I learned how to create diagrams based on an application. I am stuck on how to start the project( like code out it), I do not know where to start, but with my team's help and I find more tools that I need to start the project, I should be able to start the projects


Ramla Abdi: Worked on writing a section for the Architecture and Design document and discussed with the team on how we want the project to look and what features we wanted to keep for the minimal viable product of the website. We also discussed tools and so we chose our software and so I set it up on my device. I learned a lot about the planning of an application and doing so with a team. Had trouble cloning the repo. Currently stuck with what part I want to work on at the moment but hoping with the details gained from our next meeting I will be able to choose and start working on it.


Kianna Bolante: I set up the outlines/templates for the Architecture and Design and Team Meeting Agendas for everyone to work on, figured out coding guidelines for our project, and finished a UI mockup of what the web application would look like based off our team’s conversation on feasibility. I learned a lot about UI/UX designing in terms of design considerations. Something that I am stuck on is how to get started in coding the UI mockup into an actual functioning application.


Fatuma Meshalla: I worked on organizing our project's folder structure and explained what each files and folds do.Additionaly,  I had productive discussions with the team about our project's overall organization. We decided on the necessary database and how to obtain the data. We also discussed keeping the key features, functionality to the minimum possible. Furthermore, we discussed the importance of creating a blueprint framework to ensure everyone is on the same page. During this process, I gained valuable insights into folder structure and its significance in project organization. I also learned about CRUD operations in MongoDB and how to create attributes. However, I currently face challenges in determining the specific structure of our folders and understanding the functions of each component.
