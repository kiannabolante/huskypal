**Progress and Issues**

Fana Hagos
- I was able to complete the homepage
- Complete the testing and Continuous Integration assignment 
- I had github issue, I was able to push to github
- I had hard time with the test, there was error and I could not figure out


Ramla Abdi
- Trouble with displaying trackpal pages but working on finding and fixing the bug which so far have located and working on fixing it.
- Worked on testing and continuous integration assignment.
- Trouble before with pulling git repo to Vscode due to windows not accepting certain file names (having a colon at the end of a file name for example).


Kianna Bolante
- I learned more about Github Actions by watching the tutorial video posted in the lecture slides and taking notes but did get stuck on how to actually apply that to the project.
- I pushed new graphics for the athletic track rewards and main husky avatar.
- I worked on making the navbar work, updating its icons, and applying the design guide palette to the site.


Vasudev Raguram
- I was able to come up with a login page design that I’m currently adding finishing touches to, that will then be integrated with the rest of the application by connecting it to a database.
- I was also able to do a lot of individual learning on animation using JavaScript and HTML.
- I had trouble navigating the layout of our file structure when trying to connect GitHub actions.
- I am currently stuck on integrating my login page with the rest of the application as well as figuring out the desired layout of the page and what objects are to be manipulated.
