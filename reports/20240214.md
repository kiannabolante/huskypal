**Progress and Issues**

Ramla Abdi
- I had problems with pushing the project to github and had to reclone the folder to sign in with the right github account through the terminal. I had created the Trackpal page but had issues with the email icon with it not being interactable and displaying email links.


Kianna Bolante
- I finished a basic functionality of item placement from the closet to show for the demo. I updated the slides with content I worked on and reflection of our work so far. A problem might be that my recent pushes haven't been passing tests, so we might need to update our tests/code.


Vasudev Raguram
- I had issues with GitHub and working on the right version of the repository. My GitHub terminal had informed me that my files were up to date with the master branch but somehow when I pushed my work, other files disappeared. I also had some issues with getting some of the react test cases working and debugging the error messages.
