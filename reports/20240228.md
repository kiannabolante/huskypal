Ramla Abdi

- Fixed up the Track Pals page 
- Started work on Level system

Kianna Bolante
- Main functionality for the closet didn’t work after pulling a lot of changes from teammates, so I had a bit of trouble figuring that out.
- After talking with the team and the TA, I decided to redirect my focus into connecting a lot of our current functionality to our backend since the closet isn’t one of our main use cases.

Fatuma Meshalla
- Completed  Login, Register, Logout: make sure that  user authentication functionalities, such as allowing users to , register, and log out. Ensure these processes are smooth and secure.
- Access Control:   logout is not doing  what is supposed to do, that is not redicting the to  correct routes, and is keep saying that the user didn’t logged in while they did .

- Completing Login, Register, Logout: make sure that  user authentication functionalities, such as allowing users to log in, register, and log out. Ensure these processes are smooth and secure.
- Access Control:   preventing users from accessing routes if they're not logged in. It's good to have this security measure in place to protect certain parts of your web application from unauthorized access.
User Information Display: Displaying user information for connecting with others is a positive step.Also  only showing relevant and non-sensitive information, considering privacy and security.
