**_Team report (status update for your TA, including an agenda for the project meeting)_**

**Goals from last week**

- For the following week, we plan to finalize our content for the Architecture and Design assignment by going through any questions we have with our TA and working together to proofread content and ideas before submission.
- We also hope to get started with development now that we have our GitHub repository ready. This would be getting all of our local working environments ready and starting on our respective roles and goals as outlined below.

**Progress and Issues**

This week, we reevaluated our login design to be more general instead of specifically using UW email login. We also finished and submitted our Project Architecture and Design document and started developing a skeletal model of our app. The only issue we had this week was finding the time to meet and coordinate what we were working on due to conflicts.

**Plans and goals for following week**

- Finish Testing and Continuous Integration assignment
- Have basic frontend ready and developed (eg. needed buttons, pages, etc. made) and connect to basic backend components

**Project Meeting Agenda**

- Updates from everyone
- Bring up any blockers/challenges to TA
- Plan action items to finish continuous integration and testing assignment
